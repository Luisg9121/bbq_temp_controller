# bbq_temp_controller

The purpose of this project is to controller a bbq offset smoker by taking data(temperature from a probe) and controlling a fan that feeds air to a fire. Whether the fan is turned on/off depends on the data read in from the temperature probe.

This is run on the arduino software: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software? version 1.8.5.

You can simply copy and paste the *.ino file into the arduino IDE and run the program.

You can see from the screenshot, I am using a led light to simulate the fan: https://github.com/Luisg9121/bbq_temp_controller/blob/master/IMG_0143.JPG
